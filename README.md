# Ping Pong (2D)
## A nostalgic game
#### It's basically a game which many of us have played in the early days. As a CSE stuent it is my first project on OOP and JavaFX. For the left paddle use W A S D and for the right paddle use the arrow keys. If a player raches to 11 points, he wins. On Homepage input validation has been implemented where you cannot leave the names field empty or same.
